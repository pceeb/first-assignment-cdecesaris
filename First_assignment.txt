Hello Students,

This is what you have to do for homework.
Remember the deadline to submit the HW is Wenesday at 8:00:00 am.

I. Read chapter 2 from the book Introduction to Scientific Computing for Biologists Author.   
The book is downloadable here: https://allesinalab.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IntroSciComp2014.pdf

II. Answer the following question. What does this do?   

1. ls [A-Z]*
2. cp *.sh /tmp
3. man pwd
4. cd ~
5. mkdir -p /test1/test2/test3 
6. cp -r /tmp .
7. ls | less
8. head -n 24 test.txt Â» abc.txt
9. echo "aaa" > aaa.txt
10. ps -u sallesina
11. top
12. ls | grep .sh | xargs mv /tmp
13. du -sk /home/* | sort -r -n | head -10
14. sort -r names.txt

Answers to above:
1. Lists all the files begining with an uppercase letter of the alphabet 

2. Supposed to copy all the *.sh (shell) type files to the temporary files directory

3. Gives information help page about the pwd comand and displays its command arguments and there functions.

4. Comand to send user back to their starting home directory

5. Creates the directories test1, test2, and test 3 if they are not yet in exisitence.

6. Recursively copies the contents of tmp to the bash.

7. Sends the output of ls command through pipeline to the less command which results in the less command printing
the names of the contents of ls to the screen

8. Takes the first 24 lines in test.txt and appends it to the abc.txt file

9. Prints the string "aaa" into the file aaa.txt (will create aaa.txt if it does not exisit and will override if it does)

10. Checks to see if any USER oriented programs named sallesina are running at that current time.

11. Displays system summary and current tasks being managed by the linux kernal at that time.

12. Takes output of ls (all avaible directories/files) names and sends the names into grep. Grep then will search the shell for 
these specific directories or files and send located ones as input to xargs mv /tmp command which adds the files output by grep to the
tmp folder.

13. Places all item names wihtin the home directory into a script then reverses the order of the lines and sorts them based on numerically.
Finally, prints the first ten lines of the sorted script.

14. Takes the contents of names.txt and sorts them in reverse order by line.
